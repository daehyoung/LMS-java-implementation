Improvements for the Libris Library Management System



Overview:

This file contains a list of reasonable improvements for future releases of the Libris 
Library Management System.  Most of these improvements are intended to improve the 
usability of the system.




List of Improvements:

A menu bar (for example, file, edit, etc.) to serve as an alternative to the toolbar buttons.


A general help button that displays the user manual.


A refresh button that will refresh the tab the user is currently viewing.  In the current 
system, if a change is made (for example, something is added, removed, or changed in  
the system), the change may not be visible on a client unless the tab is closed and 
reopened.


An option to print a receipt when a resource copy is checked out, checked in, renewed, 
or when a fine is paid.


Help buttons that display the help contents specifically for what the user has open.  For 
example, if a staff member has open the “Check Out Tab” for a given patron, then 
clicking the help button in the “Check Out Tab” will display the help contents pertaining to 
that tab.


The availability of a resource shown when a user searches for a resource.
